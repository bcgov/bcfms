```
3. Confirm system in maintenance mode by accessing:
   `https://(|dlvr|test)apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/bc-fossil-management`. System should not be live, and maintenance page should be displayed.
4. Backup database:
```shell
sudo -u wwwadm /bin/bash
cd /apps_ux/apps_[env]/backups/database
chmod 700 .
pg_dump -Upostgres bcfms_[env] > 2025-05-06_bcfms_pre_1.2.1.sql
gzip 2025-05-06_bcfms_pre_1.2.1.sql
chmod 400 2025-05-06_bcfms_pre_1.2.1.sql.gz
chmod 500 .
```
